flasksite
=========
This is a simple project for learning vim and python's flask web framework.

I'm building the project (.py, .html, .js files all) solely using vim on a linux laptop, and looking up everything I need to do things efficiently in vim.

The site itself is a fairly simple CRUD site for storing "units" which are configurable objects that represent things to talk about,
 and for publicly voting on and viewing them.
